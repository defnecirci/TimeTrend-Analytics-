# Financial Portfolio Analysis using Graph Theory

## Description
This project employs graph theory to analyze financial portfolios. It involves creating different graph structures based on correlation, Euclidean distance, and statistical significance, and then analyzing these graphs using various centrality measures.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Data File: `projectdata_time_series.mat`

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the script files and the required data file `projectdata_time_series.mat`.

## Structure and Interpretation
### Part 1: Graph Creation
- **Objective**: Generate graphs based on correlation, Euclidean distance, and statistical significance.
- **Output**: Three graphs G1, G2, G3 representing different relationships between portfolios.

### Part 2: Centrality Calculation
- **Objective**: Compute degree, eigenvector, and PageRank centralities for each graph.
- **Output**: Centrality values for each node in the graphs.

### Part 3: Centrality Visualization
- **Objective**: Visualize the centrality measures for each graph.
- **Visualization**: Bar graphs showing the centrality distribution of portfolios in each graph.

### Part 4: PageRank Centrality Ranking and Visualization
- **Objective**: Rank and visualize portfolios based on PageRank centrality.
- **Visualization**: Bar graphs displaying ranked centrality scores, highlighting the most influential portfolios.

## Application
This analysis can be used for risk assessment, portfolio management, and investment strategy development by identifying key portfolios and understanding portfolio interactions.
